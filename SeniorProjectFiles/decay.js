/* NOTES
 * For variables and equations,
 * 		For math f[x] denotes "f subscript x" while f(x) denotes "f of x".
 *		Clock ticks (k) are calculated while cycles (c) are just increments for counting.
 *		Number of cycles every tick calculate should be ten times the number of clock ticks.
 */


/* VARIABLES
 * W, w[x] = story, word at space x.
 * k = clock tick; "epoch".
 * m[0], m[c] = initial minor tick, minor tick at cycle c.
 * t, t[k] = current time, time at clock tick k; assume t[0] is 0.
 * n[t], n[0] = current number of words, initial number of words.
 * v = views, constatnt increasing from 1.
 * r[i], r[k] = rate at which influence decays, rate at which clock tick decays.
 * i[t] = influence of the word at time t.
 * c = cycles, number of decay cycles the system has gone through.
 */
 
/* EQUATIONS
 * DECAY CHANCE => D(t[k]) = 1/v * i(t[k])/100 
 * 		Inverse of the views times the percent influence remaining, which is exponential.
 * INFLUENCE SIMPLE => i(t[k]) = i[0]/(2^c)
 *		Influence is halved at each clock tick.
 * CALCULATE NEXT CLOCK TICK => t[k+1] = t[k]/(r[k]^c)
 * 		Next clock tick is simply exponential, depending on the variable the user set beforehand.
 * CALCULATE NEXT MINOR TICK => m[c] = ((c mod 10) + 1) * m[0] where m[0] = (t[k+1] - t[k])/10
 * 		Since the number of minor ticks are ten per major clock tick, the initial tick should be 1/10 the way through with each one after being additive.
